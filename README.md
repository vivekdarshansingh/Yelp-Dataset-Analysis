# Yelp-Dataset-Analysis
This project analyze the public Dataset provided by Yelp using SQL. Yelp is Platform for the users to provide reviews and rate their interactions with a variety of organizations like Business, Restaurants, Heath, Clubs, Hospitals, Local Government Offices, Charitable Organisations, etc.
This project is based on assignments from SQL for Data Science by University of California, Davis on Coursera. Project explores Yelp dataset and prepares the data for predictive modeling of the number of stars that users assign in their reviews. 

However, here are some of the knowledge I gained from this SQL Course:
1. Creating tables
2. Filtering, sorting, and calculating data using WHERE, SELECT, FROM, IN, OR, AND, NOT, ORDER BY
3. Using wildcards to find specific strings
4. Math operations
5. Aggregate functions such as MAX, MIN, SUM, AVG, COUNT
6. Grouping data using GROUP BY
7. Subqueries
8. Different type of joins including INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN, and self joins
9. Creating aliases
10. Using UNION queries
11. Working with string variables : Concatenations, Trimming, Substring, Upper case and Lower case
12. Date and Time Strings: STRFTIME, Date(‘now’), computing how many years have passed from a certain time period
13. Case Statements
14. Creating Views

The Entity Diagram (ER Diagram) of the Yelp dataset that we used to analyze the data is being provided in this project. Entity Diagram is basically a diagram with a set of structured tables that are being connected to each other which shows the relation between them accordinging.
